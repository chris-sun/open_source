launchctl
The launchctl command (pronounced “launch control”) sets up programs to run automatically according to a schedule or other rules. It is similar to cron but more flexible and complex. It’s also made for the Mac whereas cron comes from a Unix/Linux background. 

Launching a program requires several parts:
A program to be launched.
A property list or plist file that specifies how the program gets launched, written in XML.
Specifying whether to run as an agent or a daemon. An agent is associated with a particular user and can have a graphical user interface (GUI). A daemon is not associated with a user and cannot have a GUI.
The system service launchd, which controls all the launched programs.
The launchctl command, a front-end to launchd, which handles plist files.

To make sure the plist file has correct syntax, run the plutil command:
 ➜ plutil -lint com.example.date.plist
com.example.date.plist: OK

NOTE to Chris.
launchctl requires that user loading the plist file must be the file owner.
Hence, must use "chown" to set "someuser" to be the owner of the plist file.  Lame as hell.

  sudo chown someuser ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
  (Run the command below as "someuser" user
  launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist

To list all jobs currently loaded in launchd:

  launchctl list
